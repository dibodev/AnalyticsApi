### Project Routes
- `GET /projects`: Retrieve all projects
- `GET /projects/:id`: Retrieve a specific project by ID
- `POST /projects`: Create a new project
- `PUT /projects/:id`: Update an existing project
- `DELETE /projects/:id`: Delete a project

### Header Statistics Route
- `GET /stats/overview`: Fetch overall statistics (unique visitors, total visits, etc.), with query parameters for the period (e.g., `?period=last7days`)
- `GET /stats/:domain/overview`: Fetch statistics for a specific project by domain (unique visitors, total visits, etc.), with query parameters for the period, with query parameters for the period (e.g., `?period=last7days`)

### Visitor Graph Route
- `GET /stats/visitors-graph`: Fetch data for the visitor graph, with query parameters for the period and project ID (optional)

### Combined and Specific Project Cards Routes
- **Top Sources**
  - `GET /stats/top-sources`: Fetch top traffic sources for all projects, with query parameters for the period
  - `GET /stats/:domain/top-sources`: Fetch top traffic sources for a specific project by domain, with query parameters for the period
- **Pages**
  - `GET /stats/pages`: Fetch top, entry, and exit pages for all projects in a single request, with query parameters for the period
  - `GET /stats/:domain/pages`: Fetch top, entry, and exit pages for a specific project by domain in a single request, with query parameters for the period
- **Locations**
  - `GET /stats/locations`: Fetch statistics by countries, regions, and cities for all projects in a single request, with query parameters for the period
  - `GET /stats/:domain/locations`: Fetch statistics by countries, regions, and cities for a specific project by domain in a single request, with query parameters for the period
- **Devices**
  - `GET /stats/devices`: Fetch statistics by browsers, operating systems, and device types for all projects in a single request, with query parameters for the period
  - `GET /stats/:domain/devices`: Fetch statistics by browsers, operating systems, and device types for a specific project by domain in a single request, with query parameters for the period

Each of these routes should accept additional query parameters to filter data based on the selected period. The implementation will depend on how data is structured and stored in your database.

For real-time tracking, as mentioned, this can be handled through WebSockets or similar technology, so no specific API route is needed for that.
